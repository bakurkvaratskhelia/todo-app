# Cross-Platform Todo App

A **full-stack, real-time todo application** that runs on **iOS, Android, and the Web** from a single codebase.  
Built with **React Native + Expo** on the frontend and powered by **Convex** as the backend.

This project demonstrates cross-platform development, real-time data synchronization, and modern full-stack architecture.

## Why This Project?

I built this project to explore and demonstrate modern techniques for delivering a consistent user experience across mobile and web platforms with a **single codebase**. Leveraging **Expo** and **React Native**, I focused on seamless cross-platform UI, while **Convex** allowed me to implement real-time data sync and simplified backend logic.

### Key challenges tackled:
- Ensuring truly live updates—todos appear instantly across devices
- Organizing code for easy sharing between platforms and backend
- Navigating platform-specific quirks with Expo and React Native
